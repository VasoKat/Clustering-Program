# Clustering-Program
Clustering Program based on k-means algorithm in Java and Python with M groups.
Clustering is a neural network approach.
The program will create 1200 examples (random points (x1,x2) at the level).
The program will load the file with the examples, it will run the k-means algorithm 
with M centers and finally save the coordinates of the centers of the groups.
The generateData1.java creates 1200 examples and the outputs will be saved in data1.txt.
To display the examples in a diagram we have made the program graphask2.py.
The format of the results is the x,y coordinates of the results and the
group they belong to. The results of the program KMeans.java will be saved in kmeans3.txt file.
To display the examples in the group that the network contained them, we run the drawData.py.
This project was done in collaboration with two other fellow students.
